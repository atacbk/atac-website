We want everyone in the Atlantic Towers community to enjoy the use of the Gym, and, to
that end, the Board of Directors has adopted the following rules. These rules are typical
of the rules which are in place in other buildings throughout New York City.
1. Use of the Gym, including the exercise equipment, involves risks of injury, and use is
exclusively at the risk of the person using it. No one should use the equipment without
being technically competent and physically fit to do so. There will be no supervision of
the Gym or the equipment by the Coop or its Managing Agent.
2. Everyone intending to use the Gym must first submit a properly executed waiver and
release of liability to the Managing Agent. Parents must sign a waiver for their minor
children, if any, and remain responsible for their behavior. Upon receipt of the signed
waiver, access to the Gym will be granted. Access may not be transferred or borrowed
by any person. If you are found to give your access to a non-authorized person, you will
incur a fine and or termination of your gym access.
3. Residents (owners, tenants and family members) over the age of 16 may use the Gym
at any time during Gym hours provided proper waivers are executed. Resident children
between the ages of 12 and 16 may only use the Gym if they are accompanied by an
adult, provided proper waivers are executed. Children under the age of 12 are not
permitted in the Gym at any time.
4. Trainers and physical therapists must first file a properly executed waiver and release
with the Managing Agent, and provide copies of their credentials, before they are granted
permission to provide their services in gym. Once approved, outside trainers and physical
therapists are permitted in the Gym when accompanied by their client. Trainers and
physical therapists are not to use the facility to train themselves and must be
accompanied by their clients while they are in the building.
5. The Gym will be open 5:00AM-12:00AM (Midnight), 7 days each week, including holidays, subject
to such temporary closings as may be necessary as determined by the Board in its sole
discretion, such as for maintenance and repair as well as for the annual meeting of
owners.
6. While others are waiting, there will be a 30-minute time limit on the use of all
equipment in the Gym.
