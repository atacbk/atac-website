Rules & Regulations
1. Management reserves the right to suspend, expel, or refuse membership
to any resident not in good standing and/or whose residency is not properly
documented or verified.
2. Management reserves the right to suspend, expel, or refuse membership to
members and their guests for conduct which in its opinion is determined to its best
interest. Members will be held responsible for the conduct of their guests. No person
to whom membership has been denied for any reason will be admitted as a guest.
No refunds will be issued.
3. All members must leave their membership cards with the lifeguards when entering
the pool area and must take them when they leave, even if temporarily. The NYC
Dept. of Health has maximum capacity rules, and the pool can be closed for
exceeding them, so the number of people in the pool area must be closely
monitored.
4. Pool entry on weekends or other high-use limes may be limited for members
and/or their guests in order to comply with the NYC Department of Health
regulations regarding the maximum capacity of pool use.
5. Children under 14 years of age must be accompanied by an adult member over
the age of 18 and may not join without an adult member. When the adult supervisor
leaves the pool area, the children must also leave unless guards are formally told
who the new adult supervisor is.
6. Smoking, vaping, alcohol, glass bottles, gambling, and pets are PROHIBITED
throughout the Pool area. Food is permitted in the picnic area only.
7. No playing radios except personal music players with headphones.
8. No ball playing or running anywhere on the deck; no flotation devices are allowed
in the pool except at the discretion of the lifeguard.
9. Chairs and lounges are permitted on the premises but not within 5 feet of Pool per
the NYC Dept. of Health. Chairs and other material left out after pool closing will be
placed in the storage room or playground and the loss of these items is the
members' responsibility. Repeat offenders will have their chairs discarded.
10. No objects may interfere with the movement of people on the deck. Baby
carriages will only be allowed in areas designated by Management. Plastic or other
types of kiddie pools, tricycles, rollerblades, scooters, wagons, skateboards,
bicycles, and other large objects are not permitted on any part of the pool deck to
prevent blocking of the deck area.
11. Before entering Pool, bathers must observe the posted sanitary regulations of the
Health Dept. No person with infection, fever, cold, cough, inflamed eyes, skin
disease, or wearing bandages shall be allowed to use the pool. All persons who
have used oils, ointments, or lotions must take a soap shower prior to entering the
